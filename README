Considered Harmful is a Ruby on Rails plugin that lets you "goto" locations rather than redirecting to them.

== Installation

script/plugin install git://github.com/ymendel/considered_harmful.git

== Using Considered Harmful
  
Say you have a controller action like so:
  
    class ThingsController < ApplicationController
      def update
        # some code here
        redirect_to thing
      end
    end

That's just way too long. Try this instead.

    class ThingsController < ApplicationController
      def update
        # some code here
        goto thing
      end
    end
